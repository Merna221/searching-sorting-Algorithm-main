**Advanced Search and Sort Algorithms with GUI**

**Project Description:**

- **Developed** a user-friendly application demonstrating and visualizing search and sort algorithms.
- **Implemented** linear search, binary search, selection sort, and bubble sort algorithms in Python.
- **Designed** a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to allow user interaction.
- **Enabled** input of data and target elements for search algorithms through the GUI.
- **Visualized** step-by-step execution of each algorithm in a detailed and informative manner.
- **Enhanced** educational value by providing clear and concise feedback on algorithm processes and results.
- **Focused** on making complex algorithm concepts accessible and understandable to users.
